# Day 1
The day is 18th of January, I learned to create the website using html and css from freecodecamp

## What I learned
I feel like I have grasped the usage and pros of properly formatting your html and the efficient usage of class names in html as well as main and section tags.
I also learned how to use css (atleast to some extent) usage of type selectors and class type selectors can be seen in this project.
